# FragmentDemo4

( Android ) Practice passing data from Activity to a Fragment using the Fragment Object

There are 2 Ways to pass data from an Activity to a Fragment

1. Using the Bundle Object
2. Using the Fragment Object

This is a practice project for passing data using the Fragment Object.

While the Bundle Object is usually used to pass Primitive Data Types (String, int, float, long) the 
Fragment Object can not only be used to pass Primitive Data Types but also to pass Non-Primitive Data Types 
(HashMap, ArrayList, and custom Class like Employee or Student)
